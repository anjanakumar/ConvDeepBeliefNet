# ConvDeepBeliefNet
Attempt to create my own Convolutional Deep Belief Net starting from the Restricted Boltzmann machine in https://github.com/lisa-lab/DeepLearningTutorials/, and using some guidance from https://github.com/ahelou2/deep-learning-scene-recognition/ and https://github.com/OFAI/lrn2 to add convolutions.
